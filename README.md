## Intro
Have you already missed a concert of your favorite band in Paris because you weren't notified? Or didn't you know some really events took place when you were there and it was too late to have a ticket?
In fact, Paris has its own API at https://opendata.paris.fr/explore/dataset/que-faire-a-paris-/api/ to have access to the previous and next events in Paris and nearabouts.

## How it works

It's a basic use of Paris' API to filter events based on tags. Then the events are added into your calendar.
You can pick any filter you want within a wide range of tags. There can be multiple filters at the same time.
